AI Social Media Post Advisor

Have you ever felt confused about whether you should upload a post or not—on Instagram or as a WhatsApp status?
Questions like:
Do I look good in this picture?
-Does it look relevant?
-Am I revealing any personal details unintentionally?
-To solve this, I am building an AI Social Media Post Advisor.

This tool helps users decide whether they should post an image on a specific platform. You upload your picture and select the platform you are considering (e.g., Instagram or WhatsApp). The AI analyzes the image, extracts visual features, checks the background, lighting conditions, clothing, and potential privacy concerns.

Based on the analysis, the AI provides suggestions such as:
-You can post the image directly
-Apply an Instagram warm filter at 60% (if Instagram is selected)
-Avoid uploading the image because the background is not suitable
-Warning if sensitive or personal details are visible
